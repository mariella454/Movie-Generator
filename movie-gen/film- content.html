      <h1>What movie should we watch? </h1>
      <p><em>A helpful guide for those who cannot agree on a movie </em></p>
        <p id="Instructions">Instructions: You and your partner will choose one movie from each genre. In turn, we will produce a suitable movie option based on your choices. </p>

        <h2>Genres </h2>
        <p>If you like ROMANCE, choose between: </p>
        <ul><li>a) A Walk to Remember </li></ul> <img src="RomanceA.jpg"/>
        <ul><li>b) 10 Things I Hate About You </li></ul> <img src="RomanceB.jpg"/>
        <p>If you like ACTION, choose between: </p>
        <ul><li>a) The Hunger Games </li></ul> <img src="ActionA.jpg"/>
        <ul><li>b) Jumanji </li></ul> <img src="ActionB.jpg"/>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Results </h3>
        <p>a + a = <strong>The Giver </strong></p> <img src="a+a.jpg"/>
          <ul><li>Both <em>The Hunger Games</em> and <em>The Giver</em> are dystopian films and have a romance going on between the two main characters. <em>A Walk to Remember</em> features the same type of opposites attract love that's also shown in The Giver. </li></ul>
        <p>a + b = <strong>Titanic </strong></p> <img src="a+b.jpeg"/>
          <ul><li>All three movies show a woman protagonist and a opposites attract type of love. </li></ul>
        <p>b + a = <strong>Avatar </strong></p> <img src="b+a.png"/>
          <ul><li>The concept of entering into a video game (i.e. <em>Jumanji</em>) or becoming a different species (i.e. <em>Avatar</em>) is one commonality. The love interest pairs in <em>A Walk to Remember</em> and the recommended film hold different world perspectives and influence each other for the better.</li></ul>
        <p>b + b = <strong>Miss Congeniality </strong></p> <img src="b+b.jpg"/>
          <ul><li>Humor is the common thread between all 3 films. Both <em>10 Things I Hate About You</em> and the recommended film have socially defiant female protagonists. In addition, <em>Jumanji</em> and the recommended film involve characters breaking out of their day-to-day lives and assuming new identities.</li></ul>
